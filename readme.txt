Redirect user by cookie value

= Plugin Description =
Redirect user by cookie value : from htaccess or earliest WP-CONFIG hook, to avoid WP loading. 

So minimal latency and time savings when redirecting users. (This might save about average 200-500ms if using other redirection methods, like typical plugins, that are hooked with `init`)
